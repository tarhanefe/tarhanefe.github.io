 The project focuses on **fostering safer online spaces** by developing deep learning models that detect hate speech in various formats, including text, images, memes, videos, and audio content. The project repository can be found in the given [link](https://github.com/tarhanefe/Deep_Learning).

### Objectives
- Develop deep learning models that accurately classify hate speech while minimizing false positives.
- Evaluate model performance with benchmarks and interpretability metrics.
- Address ethical and legal considerations in AI-powered content moderation.

### Project Structure

The repository contains the following directories and files:

#### Directories

- `cleaned_data/` contains the preprocessed data
- `data/` contains the raw data that we download (paradetox.tsv)
- `data_preprocessing/` contains scripts for loading and preprocessing datasets.
- `eval/` includes evaluation routines and performance metrics.
- `trainer/` implements the training loop and model management.
- `utils/` provides utility functions used across the project.
- `visualizatios/` contains a folder with the plots used in our report.

#### Top-Level Files

- `README.md` – Main project documentation.
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies.
- `main_config.yaml` – Configuration file for training and evaluation.
- `main.py` – Entry point to run the training pipeline.
- `basic_running_scripts.sh` – Shell script(s) to launch experiments.
- `tokens.yaml` – Contains token/API configuration if needed.
- `starter.sh` - Center script that runs the training

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/charafkamel/Deep_Learning.git
   cd Deep_Learning
   ```

### Setup & Installation
2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional)
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Dataset
To train, evaluate and test the model we use the paradetox dataset from https://github.com/s-nlp/paradetox/blob/main/paradetox/paradetox.tsv. It is a parallel detoxification dataset containing over more than <b>12,000 toxic-neutralized sentence pairs</b>. Collected via crowdsourcing using Reddit, Twitter and Jigsaw. Ensures semantic similarity and fluency while removing toxicity.


### Model Architecture
We use the Qwen3-0.6B model and the T5-base model as our primary architectures, representing decoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures respectively.


### Training
This project supports **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** and **Reinforcement Learning (GRPO)** training for both encoder-decoder (Seq2Seq) and decoder-only models. Below are the available training configurations and how to use them.

---

### Available Training Setups

We support five different training setups:

#### 1. Encoder-Decoder (Seq2Seq) Models
- `--base`: Train using standard cross-entropy loss
- `--count`: Train using our custom loss function

#### 2. Decoder-Only Models
- `--base_generative`: Train using standard cross-entropy loss
- `--count_generative`: Train using our custom loss function
- `--rl`: Train using Reinforcement Learning (GRPO) with our custom reward function

### How to Train

Run the following command with the appropriate flag:

```bash
python main.py --base              # Seq2Seq with standard loss
python main.py --count             # Seq2Seq with custom loss
python main.py --base_generative   # Decoder-only with standard loss
python main.py --count_generative  # Decoder-only with custom loss
python main.py --rl                # Decoder-only with RL (GRPO)
```

### Evaluation
To evaluate model performance:
```sh
python eval/eval.py
```
This will run the evaluation script on all of the saved models under the defined hugging-face account (defined in main_config.yml with the "hf_username" parameter). The results will be saved in a csv under

### Run everything
It is also possible to run all of the training using the starter script:
```sh
./starter.sh
```
This will launch all 5 training jobs in parallel. After those are finished running, we might launch the evaluation script
